About Performance Plus:

Performance Plus is designed for PvE servers to help manage the large number of conveyors and turrets often placed, which can become a problem with and without entity limits, It even has some basic optimizations at startup (Credits to Farkas).

How it works:

When players log out, the plugin automatically deactivates their conveyors and turrets. This reduces the number of unnecessary active devices.
Additionally, the plugin includes VIP permissions, allowing VIP players to keep their conveyors and turrets active even after logging out. It also supports toggle commands for all players.
Importantly, the plugin maintains Rust's core gameplay dynamics. It ensures turrets and conveyors aren't powerless and requires appropriate power levels for players to toggle their devices.

Concerned about server lag when locating all devices on the map?

There's no need to worry. The plugin does this progressively and only once, ensuring theres no lag spike or server fps dips, even during plugin reloads.

Commands:

/toggle - Shows the gui

Permissions:

performanceplus.vip > (VIP Players devices are always on)
